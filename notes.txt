=> App component is the 'Root' component for the application.

=> Any text has to be inside the Text component, unlike web.

=> Styling in react native is inspired by css, that is, it is relatable to css, but many things are different.

=> Using StyleSheet object is helpful in 2 ways.
  1. Auto completion
  2. Provides validation (if you use invalid style/properties -> error)

=> Components have flexbox enabled by default, unlike web.

=> Flex
  1. Main axis
    - row = left to right
    - column = top to bottom
    - row-reverse = right to left
    - column-reverse = bottom to top
    - justifyContent (Can't use stretch here, so go to children components to specify "how much space it should take of the space it can get along the main axis")

  2. Cross axis
    - the other axis
    - alignItems (default is 'stretch')

=> Event Handling - Similar to web

=> Sometimes there can be a difference between android and ios for styling.
  - View is a more general component than Text.

=> Unlike web, styles do not cascade (tranferring of style to children eg. color)
